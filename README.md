This is a variation of the classic Snake game with a twist - bombs! In this version of the game, you control a snake that must find and eat apples while avoiding bombs that appear on every iteration of an apple eat. It adds an extra layer of challenge and excitement to the traditional Snake gameplay.

How to Play
Objective: The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without running into bombs.

Movement: Use the arrow keys (or WASD keys) to control the snake's direction.

Eating Apples: The snake will grow longer each time it eats an apple, increasing the score. Eating an apple will also cause bombs to appear in new locations.

Avoiding Bombs: Avoid running into bombs at all costs. If the snake collides with a bomb, the game is over!

Scoring: Your score increases with each apple eaten. Try to beat your high score or compete with friends for the top spot!
